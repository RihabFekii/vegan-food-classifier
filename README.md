# Find me vegan food ðŸ‘€ 
A Computer Vision project for vegan food ðŸŒ± recognition. 

A web-based app to classify vegan food from non-vegan food using Roboflow. 

### A step-by-step guide to this project 
1. Data annotation using Roboflow's annotation tool
2. Data pre-processing
3. Training an ML model on Roboflow
4. Deploying the ML model
5. Creating a web app with Streamlit 


# Data preparation 

You can have a nice AI project idea in mind ðŸš€, but oftentimes, you don't find the fitting dataset. 

It was the case in my project. What I did is, I collected some images and used a tool like Roboflow to annotate and pre-process my dataset.

*With Roboflow, not finding a dataset will no longer be an obstacle!*

## Upload data 

To create a dataset, I am using [Roboflow](https://app.roboflow.com/) to upload my raw data. 

Start by creating a **workspace**, then create a **project** and select the Computer Vision **project type** that fits your use case, as shown in the figure below:

Upload your data via the **upload** interface. Adding **tags** to your data is highly recommended, as it enables easier search.

## Annotate data 

The next step after uploading data on vegan and omnivore food is annotation. 

Roboflow has a built-in **annotation tool** that I will use to annotate my data for my object detection task. 

The picture below shows the annotation tool interface. I can easily draw the **bounding box** around the plate and assign the **labels** "vegan" or "omnivore" to my plate(s) in my images.
